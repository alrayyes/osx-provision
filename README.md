# osx-provision

## Prerequisites

- XCode with Command Line Tools
- Homebrew
- Homebrew Cask

----------
Provision your mac with this shell script. Forked from https://github.com/brandonb927/dotfiles. I got the original idea for this from http://lapwinglabs.com/blog/hacker-guide-to-setting-up-your-mac. Tested with OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.

Also includes a cleanup script to delete outdated casks which I ripped from https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/309#issuecomment-48072841
