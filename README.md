# Dotfiles

## Prerequisites

- XCode with Command Line Tools

----------

This is my set of dotfiles. Currently, I've got basic customizations for zsh and git.

You probably won't find anything too useful here. If you want to use these dotfiles as a base for your own:

- DON'T use this gitconfig file as it is now! Open it and replace my name and email address with your own.
- You can alias all the appropriate files in one fell swoop by running install.sh
    - However, you'll have to change those paths in install.sh and in zsh/zshrc
